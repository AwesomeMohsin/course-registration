# Course Registration

## Project Features

- Course Selection: Users can easily add courses to their cart by clicking on the 'select' button, accompanied by a success toast notification.

- Automatic Price Display: After selecting a course, its price will be automatically displayed beneath the course credits taken.

- Credit Limit: Users are allowed a maximum of 20 credits. If they attempt to select more than 20 credits, the system will generate an error toast message, indicating that exceeding 20 credits is not permitted.
